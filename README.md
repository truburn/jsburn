This portfolio is a personal project designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey as a frontend developer. My goal was to create a platform that not only highlights my technical expertise but also reflects my creativity and personality.

I aimed to achieve the following with this site:

- Engage visitors with a visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive design.
- Demonstrate technical proficiency by using modern tools and techniques like React, Emotion, and GitHub Actions.
- Tell my story as a developer in a way that is both professional and personal.

This portfolio is a living project, and I am continuously iterating to enhance its features, usability, and design. I invite you to browse the codebase to see how it all comes together â€” feedback is always welcome!

## The Tech

This portfolio is built with React and styled using Emotion for a modern, responsive design. It leverages GitHub Actions to run unit tests and Storybook on every push, ensuring reliability and consistency. The site is deployed using AWS Amplify, providing robust and scalable hosting.
