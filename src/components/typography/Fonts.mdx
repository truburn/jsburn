# Fonts

Here are the available fonts and samples of each one. They should be called according to their key within the CSS files and not by their <code>font-family</code> name.

The fonts should be defined in the <code>/constants/fonts.json</code> file and linked in the <code>head</code> tag of the <code>index.html</code> file. To maintain standard weights and sizes, use the respective keys for each.

To get access to the font variable information, import the fonts JSON file. <code>import fonts from "@constants/fonts.json";</code>

Below are the available fonts for this application. Scroll down to see examples.
